# Contributing

Hi, and thanks for considering to contribute to `EliteFurretAI`! Unfortunately, right now, this project is very nascent, and I'm not sure entirely where it will go, given the VGC as a game hasn't been properly analyzed. If you would like to contribute and/or collaborate, feel free to reach out to me via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/caymansimpson/) or by opening an issue.

In the beginning, I started this project with very minimal understanding of basically everything (github, virtual environments, you name it)! So I'd like to help pass on my n00b knowledge to others like me -- I wrote a step-by-step instruction guide for n00bs to download and start building AI either off of poke-env or forking elitefurretai [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QlrOuvNUQYl4ZLsBvRUHDqjQ9ibm61Nq4lrAJfjQjpE/edit). Please reachout if there's anything you got stuck on, and let me know what you got unstuck! I can add it to a troubleshooting section for others in the future. But in general, LLMs are your friend to help you through setup :)

I use pre-commit, pyre, black, isort and flake8 to keep this repo up-to-date. You can see various the specifiications in the `.flake8`, `.pre-commit-config.yaml`, `conftest.py` and `pyproject.toml` files.
