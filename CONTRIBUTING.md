# Contributing

Hi, and thanks for considering to contribute to `EliteFurretAI`! Unfortunately, right now, this project is very nascent, and I'm not sure entirely where it will go, given the VGC as a game hasn't been properly analyzed. If you would like to contribute and/or collaborate, feel free to reach out to me via email.

I use pre-commit, pyre, black, isort and flake8 to keep this repo up-to-date. You can see various the specifiications in the `.flake8`, `.pre-commit-config.yaml`, `conftest.py` and `pyproject.toml` files.
